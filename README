Fast KD Tree in javascript, based on Duyn's java version.

Usage:

  var nodes = [
    { data: "A", coords: [1, 2]},
    { data: "B", coords: [4, 5]},
    { data: "C", coords: [9, 10]}
  ];
  var tree = new FastKDTree();
  tree.add_all(nodes);

  var k = 2;
  var query = [2, 2];
  var nearest_points = tree.k_nearest(query, 2);

Notes

  - The "data" key in each node can have an arbitrary value
  - The tree uses Euclidean distance for finding the k nearest neighbors
  - The search state uses a simple array instead of a heap - there is an optimization here

Contributions welcome!
